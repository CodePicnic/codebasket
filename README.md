# Codebasket

Codebasket is a client-side interface for [CodePicnic](https://codepicnic.com)'s consoles. It can be used as a simple web-based editor or as a web UI for other Docker-container-as-a-services.

## Requirements

* JavaScript ðŸ˜‰
* [ACE editor](https://ace.c9.io/)

## Installation

### From NPM (Using Browserify or Webpack):

`npm install codebasket`

### Using `<script>`:

Use the `codebasket.js` file located in the `build` folder.

## Usage

### From NPM (Using Browserify or Webpack):

```javascript
var CodeBasket = require('codebasket'),
    basket = CodeBasket.create({
      element: '#codebasket-test'
    });

basket.render();
```

```javascript
<div id="codebasket-test"></div>

<script src="codebasket.js"></script>
